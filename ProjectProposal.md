#Access Code 2.2 Final Project Proposal

---

###Project Name: AR Zombie
###Team Name: Carl Dies in the End
###Team Members: 
* Brian Blanco
* Elber Carneiro
* Umar Mahmud
* Jackie Meggesto

---

##The Problem
	Lack of compelling mobile games out there using Augmented Reality technology.

---

##The Solution
	Create a game with a unique / unusual mechanic that is fun to play and uses AR for added immersion and interaction. Above all, it must make a technically impressive demo. Ideally, it will also serve as a proof of concept should we choose to continue development into a more fleshed out v2.
